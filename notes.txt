- hiding the admin buttons:
    
- brad's idea of what happens whena person fills out the form:
    - in motly, I'd have a root:user/:invite.id
    - user hits sibmit
    json goes to scree, validate asnsaves
    gives me back  url that I can define
     - the name, 
     - user: brad
     -urL: /brad/birthday=spectacular
     - user accounts needs to be considered
     - people trying to send invite who aren't guests
     - user strategy: ssend someone a link in an email (with URl) .. url is essentially a password
     -  in url is usrname and other things...

DESIGNER NOTES
---------------

1) shrink header on scroll: http://callmenick.com/_development/resize-header-on-scroll/
    - Also, logo braks into two pieces, becoming horizontal
2) Typography: http://1961.today/
3) images: https://bitsofco.de/the-srcset-and-sizes-attributes/
4) nav touches: https://medium.com/swlh/creative-form-input-field-design-examples-bfe5dd50808a#.fjzbjhikn

THEME APPROACH?
---------------

1. Website pulls in the zombie theme.
2. This theme contains type specs and various backgrounds for each section.
3. Wherever there is a user image needed (like the birthday boy on cover) ... that gets pulled in from the user directory
4. Maybe the splash image is a JPG with the person's face embedded into JPG, to keep the file size down.
5. But other sections of the size have generic zombie background images that don't change on custom zombie sites.
6. Do themes actually NEED a hamburger menu? If I'm just going to stack sections on top of each other for mobile, and sometimes side-by-side on desktop ... what's in the wing menu?



------------
Left to do:
------------
- Organize CSS so that it's lean and mobile at the top
- Set up fonts so that they load depending on the theme used
- Get audio to autoplay with a constant button to mute
