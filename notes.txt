- hiding the admin buttons:
    
- brad's idea of what happens whena person fills out the form:
    - in motly, I'd have a root:user/:invite.id
    - user hits sibmit
    json goes to scree, validate asnsaves
    gives me back  url that I can define
     - the name, 
     - user: brad
     -urL: /brad/birthday=spectacular
     - user accounts needs to be considered
     - people trying to send invite who aren't guests
     - user strategy: ssend someone a link in an email (with URl) .. url is essentially a password
     -  in url is usrname and other things...
